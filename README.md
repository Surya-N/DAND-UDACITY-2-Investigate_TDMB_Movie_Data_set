# Investigate TDMB Movie Data set

The primary goal of the project is to go through the general data analysis process â€” using basic data analysis technique with NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

This project was done as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

The TMDb Movie dataset, one of Udacity's curated datasets, is a collection of information pn 10867 movies from 1966 to 2015. 

For each movie, the dataset includes information on aspects such as popularity, budget, revenue, cast, directors, production house, date of release, runtime, and its rating.

## Research Questions addressed

1. How is the film making industry evolving?

  *How much more movies people are consuming now compared to last few decades? (Growth Rate)
  *Is movie making a profitable business?
  *What are the some of the best and the not-so-good performing movies across different parameters through the years?
  
2. Does runtime hold any importance? What is the preferred runtime of viewers?

  How has the average runtime of movies changed over the years?
  What is the Average Runtime of movies currently?
  Is there any visible relationship between Revenue and Popularity with Runtime?
  
3. What are The top 10 movies of the world based on different parameters?

4. Genres

  What are the main movie genres and distribution of movies across genres?
  How do different Genres perform across different parameters?

5. Who are the most successful movie directors and film stars?

  Does having the most popular director or actor ensure financial success in the box office?

6. Which are the biggest production companies that dominate the industry?

  Number of movies churned by those production companies
  Budget spending, revenue generation and ROI of those companies
  How does Revenue depend on different parameters?
